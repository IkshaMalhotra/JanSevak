##  Overview

JanSevak is a next-generation civic issue management platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens, volunteers, NGOs, and administrative authorities. The platform transforms the traditional complaint system into a transparent, trackable, and action-oriented digital ecosystem.

Instead of complaints getting ignored in files, emails, or offline processes, JanSevak ensures every reported issue is visible, prioritized, assigned, tracked, and resolved efficiently.

This platform is built with a strong focus on:
- Transparency
- Speed of resolution
- Community participation
- Smart governance
- Real-time monitoring
- Reward-based engagement

##  Real World Problem Statement

In cities, campuses, and communities, thousands of civic issues arise every day:

- Garbage overflow in public places
- Broken street lights
- Water leakage
- Road damage / potholes
- Electricity faults
- Drainage blockage
- Sanitation issues
- Unsafe public zones
- Infrastructure maintenance complaints

## Current Complaint Systems Fail Because:

Manual Reporting
  
  - Most complaints are still submitted physically or through unorganized channels.

No Tracking System
   
  - Users do not know whether action is taken or not.

Delayed Resolution
    
  - No workflow automation leads to slow action.

Lack of Accountability
  
  - No clear ownership of complaints.

Poor Citizen Participation
  
   - People stop reporting because nothing changes.
